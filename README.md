🌟 Projects

### 1. [Smart Bus Fleet Management and Monitoring System](https://github.com/yourusername/smart-bus-fleet-management)
An embedded system device using gyroscopes for tilt detection, GPS for location tracking, and temperature and humidity sensors. It provides real-time sensor data and location information on a website for university administration and students to monitor and track buses.

### 2. Explainable Medical Diagnosis
Developed a deep learning model to diagnose diseases from medical images using LIME for model decision explanations. The project involved:
- Utilizing PyTorch for model development.
- Implementing CNN and Attention Mechanism.
- Using transfer learning and comparing results.
- Leveraging the CAPTUM library for explainability.

### 3. Short-Term Load Forecasting
Compared LSTM-based approach with ARIMA baseline for load forecasting at the appliance level using the REFIT dataset. Emphasized conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) before preprocessing to understand and visualize the dataset.

## 💼 Professional Experience
Marketing Company Startup
  - Developed strategies to increase sales through Facebook marketing for stores selling appliances.
  - Created and sent proposals to store owners, highlighting past successes in increasing sales via Facebook Marketplace.

## 📈 Data Science Projects
House Prediction Model
  - Used cross-validation with negative mean squared error (MSE) for model evaluation.
  - Predictive model for house sale conditions using a comprehensive dataset with numerous features.

## 🔍 Current Interests
- Deep learning and its applications in medical diagnosis.
- Exploring explainable AI techniques to enhance model transparency and trustworthiness.
- Continual learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies in AI and software development.
